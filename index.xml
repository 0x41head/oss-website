Do you ever shed tears of weariness or despair at the deluge of false positives your security tools continue sending your way?
Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs another way! There‚Äôs a new approach that many forward-thinking AppSec teams are embracing, including Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Dropbox, and more.
These companies are abandoning the Sisyphean task of trying to find every bug, and are instead embracing secure defaults: services, libraries, and frameworks that developers can use that prevent entire vulnerability classes from ever occurring in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Encrypted Calendars - the need and consequences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</guid><description>About this talk: We will brainstorm about;

This used to be done with grep and painstaking manual code audits, but it can be automated with a powerful semantic query language like CodeQL.
I will show how we performed a variant analysis using CodeQL which started analyzing a vulnerability in Nexus Repository Manager and ended up finding many other critical vulnerabilities including a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Germany&amp;rsquo;s Corona-Warn-App (German&amp;rsquo;s Contact tracing app).</description></item><item><title>I need help</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</guid><description>Summit Slack channel invite link hereThe Summit team is here to help you both before and during the Summit.

How should I prepare for the session I&amp;rsquo;m organizing?

Specialists are in short supply. If your assessment target handles very little data and can be down for a month, how serious can a broken control really be? You cannot pen test everything. Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. That‚Äôs where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in. Oversimplification gifted us a thousand tick-box compliance memes and arbitrary scoping decisions, often just based on spend.</description></item><item><title>SDA SE Cluster Scanner is going Open Source</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Sebastien Deleersnyder</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/sebastien-deleersnyde/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/sebastien-deleersnyde/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure By Scenario</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Secure by Scenario - Data breach at the North Pole</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario-data-breach-at-the-north-pole/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario-data-breach-at-the-north-pole/</guid><description>About this session: In this tabletop incident scenario, participants take the role of different stakeholders in a personal data breach at the North Pole.</description></item><item><title>Serverless static analysis with O2 Platform</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/feb/owasp/serverless-static-analysis-with-o2-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/feb/owasp/serverless-static-analysis-with-o2-platform/</guid><description>About this session This session will focus on how to use O2 Platform&amp;rsquo;s Static Analysis tools in a serverless (AWS Lambda) environment

O2 is designed to Automate Security Consultants Knowledge and Workflows and to Allow non-security experts to access and consume Security Knowledge
In practice the O2 Platform is a collection of Open Source modules that help Web Application Security Professionals to maximize their efforts and quickly obtain high visibility into an application&amp;rsquo;s security profile.</description></item><item><title>Session not found</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</guid><description>If you see a red link like this (when you map a working or user session):

15 OWASP authors have come up with the Manifesto, excited to have a number of them joining us in this session. We will start with an overview of what the manifesto is and continue discussing how can this be used by security people and devs together. What are you most interested about it? Come and share you opinion and questions. All are welcome! chat output from the session: 18:35:25 From Brook Schoenfield : Don‚Äôt pay attention to that: Avi contributed quite a lot to the manifesto, as did everyone 18:36:47 From Avi D : :-) 18:39:22 From Brook Schoenfield : Also, because threat modelling includes ‚Äúart‚Äù grounded in experience, approaches tend to be aesthetic and stylistic 18:40:05 From Avi D : 100% Brook.</description></item><item><title>Threats categorization, pitfalls, different ways of applying it in practise</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/threats-categorization-pitfalls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/threats-categorization-pitfalls/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Tickets</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/tickets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/tickets/</guid><description>Summit Slack channel invite link hereWe currently offer two ways to buy tickets to the Open Security Summit.

For example, SQL is a DSL for relational database queries, and YAML is a DSL for text file formats.
In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I think that using a DSL is one of the best ways to write and automate tests. This talk is meant to be a &amp;ldquo;think big&amp;rdquo; talk rather than a technical demonstration.</description></item><item><title>Vandana Verma</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/vandana-verma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/vandana-verma/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Venue</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/venue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/venue/</guid><description>The venue OSS is returning to Woburn Forest Center Parks
