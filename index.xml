Although valuable, they are often time-consuming and with engineering teams under increasing pressure to deliver software faster, they require techniques to automate as much of the process as possible.
Fraser will explore these challenges and how infrastructure as code is uniquely able to meet them.

Why? Because the IT industry&amp;rsquo;s supercharged development capabilities far outpace regulatory bodies' ability to set boundaries and minimal security requirements. In the meantime, a few organizations have put forth recommendations, but not everyone follows them, and sometimes it gets lost in translation. As such we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at various regulations and recommendations, and then see where some of what exists on the market today is lagging behind</description></item><item><title>Check out their (lateral) moves!

Single page applications use some flavor of JavaScript, like react. This builds on top of nodejs for package management, but only needs it for building static JS and CSS files which can be served by any web server. Nodejs packages will pull other packages they depend upon and they will bring many vulnerabilities along. Creating a docker container for building the react app and publishing it without any vulnerabilities is a challenge.</description></item><item><title>Cooking the perfect docker container for a react app Part 2</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jan/kubernetes/cooking_the_perfect_docker_container_for_a_react_app_part2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jan/kubernetes/cooking_the_perfect_docker_container_for_a_react_app_part2/</guid><description>About this session After working with a react JS application in part 1, were going to containerize it.

Creation of policies, and making them available within the company Reading policies and choosing requirements Demonstrating compliance to a governance body or an auditor How the first item is done has an influence on how well the second and third can take place. If we move away from text editors, like MS word, and develop policies as code, including version control in git, there is a possibility to have a win-win situation for all stakeholders: a) ISMS: policies are easy to maintain, changes can be audited, discussions about changes kept as issues or items in the change board (if using gitlab or github), proof reading and comments are easier to merge.</description></item><item><title>Drinks and Persona Building: Creating Adversary Trading Cards (1st Session)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/social/drinks-and-persona-building-creating-adversary-trading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/social/drinks-and-persona-building-creating-adversary-trading/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session Mark Miller (@EUSP) (aka Senior Storyteller) walks us through the adversary cards created so far.

Do you ever shed tears of weariness or despair at the deluge of false positives your security tools continue sending your way?
Don’t worry, there’s another way! There’s a new approach that many forward-thinking AppSec teams are embracing, including Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Dropbox, and more.
These companies are abandoning the Sisyphean task of trying to find every bug, and are instead embracing secure defaults: services, libraries, and frameworks that developers can use that prevent entire vulnerability classes from ever occurring in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Emil Wåreus</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/emil-wareus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/emil-wareus/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Encrypted Calendars - the need and consequences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</guid><description>About this talk: We will brainstorm about;

By outsourcing the platform to a trusted cloud provider, you accelerate innovation and stay ahead of the competition.

Not surprisingly, management of identities and permissions
is different from one public cloud to the next, adding more complexity to the fray.

Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s SDLC, OWASP SAMM, BSIMM, and more recently NIST, have threat modeling as a foundation stone in the SDLC which will help in finding vulnerabilities and preventing their exploitation by taking the perspective of an attacker. &amp;ldquo;Think like an attacker&amp;rdquo; is easier said than done. Practitioners come to Cybersecurity from different backgrounds: development, system or network administration, compliance, pentesting, and many others.</description></item><item><title>Hanuma</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/hanuma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/hanuma/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Harry Georgiou</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/harry-georgiou/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/harry-georgiou/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Harry Giorgiou</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/harryg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/harryg/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - DevSecOps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</guid><description>About this session In this session we will look at the amazing DecSecOps tools that OWASP community has created</description></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - DevSecOps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</guid><description>About this session In this session we will look at the amazing DecSecOps tools that OWASP community has created</description></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - Guides and Testing Tools</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-guides-and-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-guides-and-testing/</guid><description>About this session In this session we will look at the amazing Guides and Testing Tools that OWASP community has created</description></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - Guides and Testing Tools</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-guides-and-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-guides-and-testing/</guid><description>About this session In this session we will look at the amazing Guides and Testing Tools that OWASP community has created</description></item><item><title>How to measure and visualise ISG standards</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-measure-visualise-standards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-measure-visualise-standards/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 00:58:58 WallabyCurtis: Yara: https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara yextend: https://github.com/BayshoreNetworks/yextend &amp;ldquo;A curated list of awesome YARA rules, tools, and resources.&amp;quot;: https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara

This used to be done with grep and painstaking manual code audits, but it can be automated with a powerful semantic query language like CodeQL.
I will show how we performed a variant analysis using CodeQL which started analyzing a vulnerability in Nexus Repository Manager and ended up finding many other critical vulnerabilities including a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Germany&amp;rsquo;s Corona-Warn-App (German&amp;rsquo;s Contact tracing app).</description></item><item><title>I need help</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</guid><description>Summit Slack channel invite link hereThe Summit team is here to help you both before and during the Summit.

STRIDE is good for brainstorming. But as I follow you in your explanation, a lot of implicit knowledge is required to memorise in which forms actually spoofing and tampering etc. can materialise. I used various sources - STRIDE, but also OWASP ASVS and NIST SP 800-53 controls to derive a guidance for the security workshop during which the DFD is developed etc.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Wardley Mapping by Chris Daniel</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/introduction-to-wardley-mapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/introduction-to-wardley-mapping/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 00:40:47 Dinis Cruz: For new joiners please go to https://app.mural.co/t/lef9577/m/lef9577/1591189249671/c2a9c9398609f702ea325e8f3375f3fbc5b50b3e 00:48:15 Avi Douglen: Should evolution be measured by the industry standard, ie what possibly exists - or according to our own implementation / adoption of known standards? 01:02:48 Chris D: https://doctrine.wardleymaps.com/ 01:08:07 Avi Douglen: would it make sense to have domain-specific doctrine? eg generic, always-useful security principles. and then compare yourself vs competitors on those doctrine?</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Wardley Mapping by Goher Mohammad</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction2/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 14:19:19 From Wallaby Curtis : In relation to amount of usage? 14:21:57 From Michele Chubirka : Yes, finally someone can explain Wardley maps

task management tool, but for Glasswall it is a graphing database allowing us to mark and map anything we wish to. Combined with the power of Jupyter notebooks, we have stunning new ways to organize and visualize our data. Utlizing Jira’s API, secure authentication ensures that data doesn’t get into the wrong hands, and all the same flexible privilege options that we set in Jira will apply in Jupyter.</description></item><item><title>Jobs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/jobs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/jobs/</guid><description>Community and Project Manager (Contractor) Coordinate and Organise OSS logistics and operations Bookkeeping and financial costs Manage supplier relationships Keep an eye and manage OSS Gmail inboxes Miscellaneous tasks Support OSS Community Ownership OSS web assets (social media, Hey Summit, website, youtube) Answer queries from the community PR Official documentation (sponsor, supplier contracts, etc) Publish outcomes Project management Manage tasks for Upwork resources Manage venue relationship Running virtual events (like Working Sessions) Organisation of OSS 2021 event Desired Skills Event management Project Management Distributed leadership Community outreach Financial management Excellent written English Experience in Slack GitHub Gsuite Quickbooks Social media management Zoom webinars Upwork hiring Jira Apply</description></item><item><title>John Melton</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/john-melton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/john-melton/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Jonathan Marcil</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/jonathan-marcil/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/jonathan-marcil/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Joseph Katsioloudes</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/joseph_katsioloudes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/joseph_katsioloudes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Juan Spinel</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/juan-spinel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/juan-spinel/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Katie Charlton</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/katie-charlton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/katie-charlton/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Keynote - Open Security Summit 2020</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/jun/keynotes/keynote-open-security-summit-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/jun/keynotes/keynote-open-security-summit-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kim Carter</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/kim-carter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/kim-carter/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kim Wuyts</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/kim-wuyts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/kim-wuyts/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Learn Threat Modeling using the amazing OSS resources</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/threat-modeling/learn-threat-modeling-using-the-amazing-oss-resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/threat-modeling/learn-threat-modeling-using-the-amazing-oss-resources/</guid><description>About this session The OSS has hosted many sessions focused on Threat Modeling.

Chances are, that if you work at a big corporation your current requirements don&amp;rsquo;t cover when half the ground that ASVS covers.
If you work at a small company or startup there might not even be a set of requirements.
In either case, it would be great to be able to take ASVS and make it truly your own: your corporate image fonts, cover, maybe change the document&amp;rsquo;s name or match it to current requirements that might already exist.</description></item><item><title>Managing projects using Github Issues and ZenHub</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/may/devsecops/managing-projects-using-github-issues-and-zenhub/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/may/devsecops/managing-projects-using-github-issues-and-zenhub/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Mario Clark</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mario_clark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mario_clark/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mario Platt</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mario-platt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mario-platt/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mark Felegyhazi</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/mark_felegyhazi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/mark_felegyhazi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mark Potkewitz</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mark-potkewitz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/mark-potkewitz/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Martin Obiols</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/martin_obiols/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/martin_obiols/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Matt Johnson</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/matt-johnson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/matt-johnson/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Matthew Coles</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/matthew-coles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/matthew-coles/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Matthew Pigram</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/matthew-pigram/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/matthew-pigram/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Maturity Mapping: Contextualise change and learning</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/wardley-maps/maturity-mapping-contextualise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/wardley-maps/maturity-mapping-contextualise/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Michael Hidalgo</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/michael-hidalgo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/michael-hidalgo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mitigating Risks Through Open-Source Bitcoin Tracing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/mitigating-risks-through-open-source-bitcoin-tracing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/mitigating-risks-through-open-source-bitcoin-tracing/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Modern Office Spaces</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/governance/modern-office-spaces/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/governance/modern-office-spaces/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Moldable development with Glamorous Toolkit Part 1</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/misc/moldable-development-with-glamorous-toolkit-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/misc/moldable-development-with-glamorous-toolkit-part-1/</guid><description>About this session Glamorous Toolkit is the moldable development environment.

The Juice Shop lets people attack a real(ish) web application - which looks like a normal eCommerce Shop - and learn step by step about some of the most impactful vulnerabilities.
When you are running a Security Training for developers based on the Juice Shop you have one problem: How can every developer run and access his own Juice Shop Instance to train his skills?</description></item><item><title>Naresh Chouhan</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/naresh-chouhan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/naresh-chouhan/</guid><description/></item><item><title>NCSC - Safe File Import Pattern</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/ncsc-safe-file-import/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/ncsc-safe-file-import/</guid><description>About this talk: The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have published a pattern on how to safely import data into an organization. This can be found at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pattern-safely-importing-data
The pattern fundamentally recommends a Transform and Verify approach to imports as shown below:
This has some significant differences to import processes typically in use in commercial environments.
The objective of this session is to raise the awareness of this pattern, highlight the differences in the pattern and the pros/cons of them, and to explore the practicalities of using this patter in commercial environments.</description></item><item><title>New OSS Projects</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/new-oss-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/new-oss-projects/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Nicolas Boeckh</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/nicolas-boeckh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/nicolas-boeckh/</guid><description/></item><item><title>O365 Security - Anti-Phishing best practises and Demo</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Office Documents ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</guid><description>About this talk: Once learning about the potential areas of concern that exist within office documents and exploring ISGs for them, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to discover the testing strategies that will be oriented on validation of the requirements of the ISGs.

By 2025 it is estimated $10.5 trillion will be lost to cyber criminals.
Hacking humans is a very lucrative business. Social engineering is one of the easiest and most effective ways to access a secure system. Cyber criminals know this, and they are increasingly leaning on the research and techniques of the social science disciplines to leverage the human element into letting them into our lives, our businesses and our bank accounts.</description></item><item><title>Refresher on Security Labels</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/nov/security-labels/refresher-on-security-labels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/nov/security-labels/refresher-on-security-labels/</guid><description>Session Description Following from the Security Labels for Covid Apps session at the 2020 Open Security Summit and in preparation for the Security Labels &amp;amp; Schrems II happening on Thursday this session will focus on :

Specialists are in short supply. If your assessment target handles very little data and can be down for a month, how serious can a broken control really be? You cannot pen test everything. Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. That’s where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in. Oversimplification gifted us a thousand tick-box compliance memes and arbitrary scoping decisions, often just based on spend.</description></item><item><title>SDA SE Cluster Scanner is going Open Source</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</guid><description>About this session The Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans.

Security is implemented directly into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically and continuously detect security vulnerabilities.
Adopting SaC tightly couples application development with security and vulnerability management, while simultaneously enabling developers to focus on core features and functionality. More importantly, it improves the collaboration between Development and Security teams and helps nurture a culture of security across the organization.</description></item><item><title>Security Champions AND/OR Security Program Metrics That Matter</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/governance/security_champions_security_program_metrics_that_matter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/governance/security_champions_security_program_metrics_that_matter/</guid><description>About this session https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TIMqPKnPeQ&amp;amp;t=3s https://wehackpurple.com/building-security-champions/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG94o0DI_O0</description></item><item><title>Security Labels &amp; Schrems II</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/nov/security-labels/security-labels-and-schrems-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/nov/security-labels/security-labels-and-schrems-ii/</guid><description>Session Description As per the Schrems II ruling the US is no longer an adequate country for EU personal data.

To help companies with this, this working session will be a joint event between the Open Security Summit and the BCS focussed on the data flows.</description></item><item><title>Security-Scan your production images</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration.md/</guid><description>About this session The ClusterScanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans.
It is recommended to run the Cluster Scanner in production environments.
As a developer, the ClusterScanner works out of the box.
As a system operator, I just have to add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example Argo CD. The benefit is to get feedback on what is in production and not what should be in production.</description></item><item><title>SEMI-SOCIAL: Improv Comedy as a Social Engineering Tool</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/social/improv-comedy-as-a-social-engineering-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/social/improv-comedy-as-a-social-engineering-tool/</guid><description>About this talk: Have you ever gotten an &amp;ldquo;urgent call about you car warranty&amp;rdquo; or a demand that &amp;ldquo;you need to pay the IRS by credit card right now&amp;rdquo;? Social Engineering is the practice of talking your way into or out of situations, and is often employed by the underhanded, but can also be used to defend against those very attacks.
The rules of improv comedy can apply to many social interactions, including bluffing your way to compromise a target.</description></item><item><title>Session not found</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</guid><description>If you see a red link like this (when you map a working or user session):
