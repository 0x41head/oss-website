By automating your process you can add consistency and speed then focus human efforts on the higher risk and complicated assessments.</description></item><item><title>Abbas Haidar</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/abbas-haidar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/glasswall/abbas-haidar/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Abhinav Sejpal</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/abhinav-sejpal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/abhinav-sejpal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/about/</guid><description>The Summit venue at Woburn Forest has great surroundings

The Open Security Summit stands with members of our community and others worldwide in demanding equality for all humankind.
The recent events and the associated demonstrations throughout the world are just the most recent examples of hateful violence aimed at the diverse communities of the world.

Why? Because the IT industry&amp;rsquo;s supercharged development capabilities far outpace regulatory bodies' ability to set boundaries and minimal security requirements. In the meantime, a few organizations have put forth recommendations, but not everyone follows them, and sometimes it gets lost in translation.

Single page applications use some flavor of JavaScript, like react. This builds on top of nodejs for package management, but only needs it for building static JS and CSS files which can be served by any web server. Nodejs packages will pull other packages they depend upon and they will bring many vulnerabilities along. Creating a docker container for building the react app and publishing it without any vulnerabilities is a challenge.</description></item><item><title>Creating 1 million kubernetes pods - Lessons learned</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/lessons-learned-with-creating-1-million-kubernetes-pods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/lessons-learned-with-creating-1-million-kubernetes-pods/</guid><description>About this session Session to present and discuss lessons learned when creating 1 million kubernetes pods</description></item><item><title>Creating a Scalable API Test Framework using AWS and Elastic</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/devsecops/creating-a-scalable-api-test-framework-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/devsecops/creating-a-scalable-api-test-framework-in-aws/</guid><description>About this session Learn how a highly scalable API Test Framework was created using AWS and Elastic</description></item><item><title>Creating Secure Builds of Containers</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/creating-secure-builds-of-containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/creating-secure-builds-of-containers/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Cristian Klein</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/cristian-klein/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/cristian-klein/</guid><description/></item><item><title>CTO Roundtable</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mar/governance/cto-roundtable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mar/governance/cto-roundtable/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>CVE CWE CVSS CWSS where do I look first?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/risk-and-governace/cve-cwe-cvss-cwss-where-do-i-look-first/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/risk-and-governace/cve-cwe-cvss-cwss-where-do-i-look-first/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>David Clarke</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/david-clarke/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/david-clarke/</guid><description>Author of the only online course on Breach Management course that is APMG/GCHQ Certified.

Do you ever shed tears of weariness or despair at the deluge of false positives your security tools continue sending your way?
Don’t worry, there’s another way! There’s a new approach that many forward-thinking AppSec teams are embracing, including Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Dropbox, and more.
These companies are abandoning the Sisyphean task of trying to find every bug, and are instead embracing secure defaults: services, libraries, and frameworks that developers can use that prevent entire vulnerability classes from ever occurring in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Encrypted Calendars - the need and consequences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</guid><description>About this talk: We will brainstorm about;

Not surprisingly, management of identities and permissions
is different from one public cloud to the next, adding more complexity to the fray.

This used to be done with grep and painstaking manual code audits, but it can be automated with a powerful semantic query language like CodeQL.
I will show how we performed a variant analysis using CodeQL which started analyzing a vulnerability in Nexus Repository Manager and ended up finding many other critical vulnerabilities including a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Germany&amp;rsquo;s Corona-Warn-App (German&amp;rsquo;s Contact tracing app).</description></item><item><title>I need help</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</guid><description>Summit Slack channel invite link hereThe Summit team is here to help you both before and during the Summit.

What infrastructure will be available at the Venue? We will try to set up some Docker servers and maybe even a Kubernetes or Open Stack setup, depending on needs/time.
Also, we need to run a local copy of the Summit site there (together with its ELK monitoring stack).
This setup should be reachable from the Venue network, and its initial purpose will be to have the Summit site and other test sites like [JuiceShop] 2.</description></item><item><title>Introduction into OWASP DSOMM</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/owasp/introduction-into-owasp-dsomm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/apr/owasp/introduction-into-owasp-dsomm/</guid><description>About this session An introduction (for people with knowledge in security/devops) into the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model and development of maturity models is given in order to provide you with information for the hands-on workshop afterwards.

Specialists are in short supply. If your assessment target handles very little data and can be down for a month, how serious can a broken control really be? You cannot pen test everything. Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. That’s where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in. Oversimplification gifted us a thousand tick-box compliance memes and arbitrary scoping decisions, often just based on spend.</description></item><item><title>SDA SE Cluster Scanner is going Open Source</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</guid><description>About this session The Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans. As a developer, the Cluster Scanner works out of the box. As a system operator, I just add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example ArgoCD.
History, DevSecOps journey, use cases, architecture and the different security scans of the Cluster Scanner will be described.

BCS recently did a recent webinar on the legal aspects here [https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/webinar-what-do-you-need-to-know-about-schrems-ii/].
So far, the ICO guidance in the UK is to map your data flows in preparation for further guidance.

It is recommended to run the Cluster Scanner in production environments.
As a developer, the ClusterScanner works out of the box.
As a system operator, I just have to add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example Argo CD. The benefit is to get feedback on what is in production and not what should be in production.</description></item><item><title>Session not found</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/faq/help/session-not-found/</guid><description>If you see a red link like this (when you map a working or user session):
