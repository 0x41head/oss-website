Everyone wants to put tests into the release pipeline, but no one wants to wait hours for them to finish. In this talk we will discuss multiple options for adding dynamic application security testing (DAST) to your CI/CD, in ways that won’t compromise speed or results, such as limiting scope, using HAR files, using test subsets, etc. Then we will do it!</description></item><item><title>Adversary Simulation: Close the Gaps in Your Security Posture</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/adversary-simulation-close-the-gaps-in-your-security-posture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/adversary-simulation-close-the-gaps-in-your-security-posture/</guid><description>About this session Can you validate your security posture and assess your network resilience against an adversary?

Insecure passwords and direct internet connections also still pose a challenge, as well as lack of security staff and skilling dedicated to these systems.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain and its security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</guid><description>About this session Will cover many key aspects of blockchain like: • What are block and chain and how does it become a blockchain • Working on blockchain technology • Blockchain properties, benefits, and applications • Consensus algorithms and real-world use cases • Mining, Hash Functions, and Cryptographic keys • Blockchain eco-system and smart contract vulnerabilities</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourcing Security Talent</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>How can we make Grafana a great open source security tool for DevSecOps?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/how-can-we-make-grafana-a-great-open-source-security-tool.devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/how-can-we-make-grafana-a-great-open-source-security-tool.devsecops/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>How can we make Grafana a great open source security tool for WDT?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/how-can-we-make-grafana-a-great-open-source-security-tool-for-wdt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/how-can-we-make-grafana-a-great-open-source-security-tool-for-wdt/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Jim and Dinis Talk Appsec</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/jim-and-dinis-talk-appsec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/jim-and-dinis-talk-appsec/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Open source modern access control</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/open-source-modern-access-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/open-source-modern-access-control/</guid><description>About this session https://youtu.be/1_Iz0tRQCH4</description></item><item><title>Security Champions - Sharing Experiences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/security-champions-sharing-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/security-champions-sharing-experience/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>The next Insider Threat isn't your staff!</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/the-next-insider-threat-isnt-your-staff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/the-next-insider-threat-isnt-your-staff/</guid><description>About this session Since the early research on Insiders so much has changed, from the range of technologies blocking desktops and laptops to the wired network those devices operate on. The improvements from technology vendors have got so much better that the only bad things an insider can do is click on malware. However, in that same time the number of devices which are not managed or overseen by end users has grown.</description></item><item><title>Threat Model for an Autonomous System</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/threat-modeling/threat-model-for-an-autonomous-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/threat-modeling/threat-model-for-an-autonomous-system/</guid><description>About the session:</description></item></channel></rss>
