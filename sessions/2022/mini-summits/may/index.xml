Everyone wants to put tests into the release pipeline, but no one wants to wait hours for them to finish. In this talk we will discuss multiple options for adding dynamic application security testing (DAST) to your CI/CD, in ways that won’t compromise speed or results, such as limiting scope, using HAR files, using test subsets, etc. Then we will do it!</description></item><item><title>Applying Zero Trust Principles to Industrial IoT and OT/ICS</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/applying-zero-trust-principles-to-industrial-iot-and-otics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/applying-zero-trust-principles-to-industrial-iot-and-otics/</guid><description>About this session IT and OT (Operational Technology, including the subset ICS - Industrial Control Systems) have traditionally operated and been managed separately, and tend to lack visibility and threat protection, especially due to legacy software and equipment, outdated operating systems, vendor restrictions, and other factors. Insecure passwords and direct internet connections also still pose a challenge, as well as lack of security staff and skilling dedicated to these systems.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain and its security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</guid><description>About this session Will cover many key aspects of blockchain like: • What are block and chain and how does it become a blockchain • Working on blockchain technology • Blockchain properties, benefits, and applications • Consensus algorithms and real-world use cases • Mining, Hash Functions, and Cryptographic keys • Blockchain eco-system and smart contract vulnerabilities</description></item><item><title>CTO Roundtable - May 2022</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/cto-roundtable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/cto-roundtable/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Jim and Dinis Talk Appsec</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/jim-and-dinis-talk-appsec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/jim-and-dinis-talk-appsec/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Open source modern access control</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/open-source-modern-access-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/open-source-modern-access-control/</guid><description>About this session https://youtu.be/1_Iz0tRQCH4</description></item><item><title>Security Champions - Sharing Experiences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/security-champions-sharing-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/security-champions-sharing-experience/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>The next Insider Threat isn't your staff!</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/the-next-insider-threat-isnt-your-staff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/the-next-insider-threat-isnt-your-staff/</guid><description>About this session Since the early research on Insiders so much has changed, from the range of technologies blocking desktops and laptops to the wired network those devices operate on. The improvements from technology vendors have got so much better that the only bad things an insider can do is click on malware. However, in that same time the number of devices which are not managed or overseen by end users has grown.</description></item><item><title>Threat Model for an Autonomous System</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/threat-modeling/threat-model-for-an-autonomous-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/threat-modeling/threat-model-for-an-autonomous-system/</guid><description>About the session:</description></item></channel></rss>
