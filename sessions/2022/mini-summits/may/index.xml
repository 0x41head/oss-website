Insecure passwords and direct internet connections also still pose a challenge, as well as lack of security staff and skilling dedicated to these systems.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain and its security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-securit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-securit/</guid><description>About this session Will cover many key aspects of blockchain like: • What are block and chain and how does it become a blockchain • Working on blockchain technology • Blockchain properties, benefits, and applications • Consensus algorithms and real-world use cases • Mining, Hash Functions, and Cryptographic keys • Blockchain eco-system and smart contract vulnerabilities</description></item><item><title>CTO Roundtable - May 2022</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/cto-roundtable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/cto-roundtable/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Jim and Dinis Talk Appsec</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/jim-and-dinis-talk-appsec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/jim-and-dinis-talk-appsec/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Open source modern access control</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/open-source-modern-access-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/open-source-modern-access-control/</guid><description>About this session https://youtu.be/1_Iz0tRQCH4</description></item><item><title>Security Champions - Sharing Experiences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/security-champions-sharing-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/security-champions-sharing-experience/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>The next Insider Threat isn't your staff!</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/the-next-insider-threat-isnt-your-staff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/the-next-insider-threat-isnt-your-staff/</guid><description>About this session Since the early research on Insiders so much has changed, from the range of technologies blocking desktops and laptops to the wired network those devices operate on.
