Insecure passwords and direct internet connections also still pose a challenge, as well as lack of security staff and skilling dedicated to these systems.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain and its security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</guid><description>About this session Will cover many key aspects of blockchain like: • What are block and chain and how does it become a blockchain • Working on blockchain technology • Blockchain properties, benefits, and applications • Consensus algorithms and real-world use cases • Mining, Hash Functions, and Cryptographic keys • Blockchain eco-system and smart contract vulnerabilities</description></item><item><title>Bridging the skill gap and hiring challenges in cyber</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/bridging-the-skill-gap-and-hiring-challenges-in-cyber/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/bridging-the-skill-gap-and-hiring-challenges-in-cyber/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourcing Security Talent</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>How do male and female voices project authority in Cyber</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/how-do-male-and-female-voices-project-authority-in-cyber/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/how-do-male-and-female-voices-project-authority-in-cyber/</guid><description>About this session This discussion will aim to explore authority issues connected to men/women in cyber particularly during the onboarding process and regarding retention. We will aim to explore: who people in cyber look to as authority figures in cyber today examine whether there may be any pre-programmed biases in the sector in prioritising male authority figures; how this is reflected in sector-specific literature - the citation and reference to female voices, whether there is a relationship between these ideas around authority and the confidence/competence debate, how this dichotomy in turn impacts communication between female hires and their managers during the recruitment process, how women feel being managed by other women as well as by men, whether/how these ideas and dynamics work differently in new start-up business models than in established business hierarchies.</description></item><item><title>Mentoring and it's challenges in Cyber Security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/mentoring-and-its-challenges-in-cyber-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/mentoring-and-its-challenges-in-cyber-security/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>PLOT4ai, an open source privacy threat modeling library for AI</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/plot4ai-an-open-source-privacy-threat-modeling-library-for-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/plot4ai-an-open-source-privacy-threat-modeling-library-for-ai/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Protecting Critical Data, through the implementation of Information Security Management System to meet compliance</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/protecting-critical-data-through-the-implementation-of-information-security-management-system-to-meet-compliance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/protecting-critical-data-through-the-implementation-of-information-security-management-system-to-meet-compliance/</guid><description>About this session This presentation will give an high-level view of all that is involved in adapting, and implementing a framework that is required to meet compliance and most importantly safeguard critical data from cyber attacks.</description></item><item><title>Resilience Engineering, Safety Science and Systems thinking - new tools for the complex world</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/resilience-engineering-safety-science-and-systems-thinking-new-tools-for-the-complex-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/resilience-engineering-safety-science-and-systems-thinking-new-tools-for-the-complex-world/</guid><description>About this session In this panel, we&amp;rsquo;ll have a number of security professionals who have been using different methods based on Resilience Engineering, Safety Science and Systems thinking in how they approach the practice of information and cyber security. We&amp;rsquo;ll hear first hand how transformative these approaches can be and the benefits and challenges they bring.

Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials and many other cool features - for example the ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer 2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see this new tool in action.</description></item><item><title>Zero Trust Network Access Framework</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/zero-trust-network-access-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/zero-trust-network-access-framework/</guid><description>About this session It will clearly explain that ZTNA is a framework or a combination of solutions that can help you against if not all at least most of the threats out there like Zero Day Attacks, Malware based attacks, Phishing, Data Loss, &amp;amp; many more.</description></item></channel></rss>
