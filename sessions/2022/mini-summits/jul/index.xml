Insecure passwords and direct internet connections also still pose a challenge, as well as lack of security staff and skilling dedicated to these systems.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain and its security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/blockchain-and-its-security/</guid><description>About this session Will cover many key aspects of blockchain like: • What are block and chain and how does it become a blockchain • Working on blockchain technology • Blockchain properties, benefits, and applications • Consensus algorithms and real-world use cases • Mining, Hash Functions, and Cryptographic keys • Blockchain eco-system and smart contract vulnerabilities</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourcing Security Talent</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Protecting Critical Data, through the implementation of Information Security Management System to meet compliance</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/protecting-critical-data-through-the-implementation-of-information-security-management-system-to-meet-compliance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/protecting-critical-data-through-the-implementation-of-information-security-management-system-to-meet-compliance/</guid><description>About this session This presentation will give an high-level view of all that is involved in adapting, and implementing a framework that is required to meet compliance and most importantly safeguard critical data from cyber attacks.</description></item><item><title>The value of CTO/CISOs and how to make it work</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/the-value-of-cto-cisos-and-how-to-make-it-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/the-value-of-cto-cisos-and-how-to-make-it-work/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Zero Trust Network Access Framework</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/zero-trust-network-access-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/zero-trust-network-access-framework/</guid><description>About this session It will clearly explain that ZTNA is a framework or a combination of solutions that can help you against if not all at least most of the threats out there like Zero Day Attacks, Malware based attacks, Phishing, Data Loss, &amp;amp; many more.</description></item></channel></rss>
