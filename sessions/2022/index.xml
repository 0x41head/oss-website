Creation of policies, and making them available within the company Reading policies and choosing requirements Demonstrating compliance to a governance body or an auditor How the first item is done has an influence on how well the second and third can take place. If we move away from text editors, like MS word, and develop policies as code, including version control in git, there is a possibility to have a win-win situation for all stakeholders: a) ISMS: policies are easy to maintain, changes can be audited, discussions about changes kept as issues or items in the change board (if using gitlab or github), proof reading and comments are easier to merge.</description></item><item><title>Lessons learned from trying to create Architecture Diagrams As Code</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/lessons_learned_from_trying_to_creat_architecture_diagrams_as_code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/lessons_learned_from_trying_to_creat_architecture_diagrams_as_code/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OWASP Top Ten Part 2</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/owasp_top_10_part2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/owasp_top_10_part2/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Parsec-Hardware security at your fingertips</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/parsec_hardware_security_at_your_fingertips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/parsec_hardware_security_at_your_fingertips/</guid><description>About this session An introduction and technical overview of an open-source security project called Parsec.

PurpleTeam is a Developer focussed security regression testing CLI and SaaS targeting Web applications and APIs. The CLI is specifically targeted at sitting within your build pipelines but can also be run manually. The SaaS that does the security testing of your applications and APIs can be deployed anywhere.
Kim will briefly discuss the four year journey that has brought PurpleTeam from a proof of concept (PoC) to a production ready Developer first security regression testing CLI and SaaS.</description></item><item><title>Security an autonomous systems - a long way to go</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/governance/security_an_autonomous_systems_a_long_way_to_go/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/governance/security_an_autonomous_systems_a_long_way_to_go/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Security as Code: A DevSecOps Approach</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/security_as_code_a_devsecops_approach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/security_as_code_a_devsecops_approach/</guid><description>About this session Security as Code (SaC) is the methodology of codifying security tests, scans, and policies. Security is implemented directly into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically and continuously detect security vulnerabilities.
Adopting SaC tightly couples application development with security and vulnerability management, while simultaneously enabling developers to focus on core features and functionality. More importantly, it improves the collaboration between Development and Security teams and helps nurture a culture of security across the organization.</description></item><item><title>Security Champions AND/OR Security Program Metrics That Matter</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/governance/security_champions_security_program_metrics_that_matter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/governance/security_champions_security_program_metrics_that_matter/</guid><description>About this session https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TIMqPKnPeQ&amp;amp;t=3s https://wehackpurple.com/building-security-champions/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG94o0DI_O0</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Security Architects aka the knights of the cloud kingdom - Panel Discussion</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/cloud-security/the-cloud-security-architects-aka-the-knights-of-the-cloud-kingdom-panel-discussion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/cloud-security/the-cloud-security-architects-aka-the-knights-of-the-cloud-kingdom-panel-discussion/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling tool - IriusRisk Community Edition</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/threat-modeling/automating-architectural-risk-analysis-with-the-open-threat-model-format/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/threat-modeling/automating-architectural-risk-analysis-with-the-open-threat-model-format/</guid><description>About this session Architectural risk analysis is a crucial security activity that&amp;rsquo;s typically carried out manually in workshops.
Although valuable, they are often time-consuming and with engineering teams under increasing pressure to deliver software faster, they require techniques to automate as much of the process as possible.
Fraser will explore these challenges and how infrastructure as code is uniquely able to meet them. He&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the Open Threat Model (OTM) format and how to create files automatically using open source tools.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling tool - IriusRisk Community Edition</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/threat-modeling/threat_modeling_tool_iriusrisk_community_edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/threat-modeling/threat_modeling_tool_iriusrisk_community_edition/</guid><description>About this session The OSS has hosted many sessions focused on Threat Modeling.
