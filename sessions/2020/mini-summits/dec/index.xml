Do you ever shed tears of weariness or despair at the deluge of false positives your security tools continue sending your way?
Don’t worry, there’s another way! There’s a new approach that many forward-thinking AppSec teams are embracing, including Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Dropbox, and more.
These companies are abandoning the Sisyphean task of trying to find every bug, and are instead embracing secure defaults: services, libraries, and frameworks that developers can use that prevent entire vulnerability classes from ever occurring in the first place.</description></item><item><title>Encrypted Calendars - the need and consequences</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/governance/encrypted-calendars-the-need-and-consequences/</guid><description>About this talk: We will brainstorm about;

15 OWASP authors have come up with the Manifesto, excited to have a number of them joining us in this session. We will start with an overview of what the manifesto is and continue discussing how can this be used by security people and devs together. What are you most interested about it? Come and share you opinion and questions. All are welcome! chat output from the session: 18:35:25 From Brook Schoenfield : Don’t pay attention to that: Avi contributed quite a lot to the manifesto, as did everyone 18:36:47 From Avi D : :-) 18:39:22 From Brook Schoenfield : Also, because threat modelling includes “art” grounded in experience, approaches tend to be aesthetic and stylistic 18:40:05 From Avi D : 100% Brook.</description></item><item><title>Wardley Maps and services model at Glasswall</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-and-services-model-at-glasswall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-and-services-model-at-glasswall/</guid><description>About this session</description></item></channel></rss>
