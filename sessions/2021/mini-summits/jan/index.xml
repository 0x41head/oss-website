SOC 2 Criterias and Controls are represented in Jira - and linked - so we have a graph behind the scences Jupyter notebooks are generating reports based on all Jira issues Google sheets and slides are generated from report data All work we do, all callatoral we create, all process documentation and evidence requirements will be linked to all controls on Jira We want to scale this We want to automate We want continuous compliance</description></item><item><title>CDR Engine Standard (Part 2)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/cdr/cdr-engine-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/cdr/cdr-engine-standard/</guid><description>About this session CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) is a new technology and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a good way to differentiate between the capabilities of the multiple engines (across file types)
This session aims to kickstart the process of creating such standard.</description></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - DevSecOps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</guid><description>About this session In this session we will look at the amazing DecSecOps tools that OWASP community has created</description></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - Guides and Testing Tools</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-guides-and-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-guides-and-testing/</guid><description>About this session In this session we will look at the amazing Guides and Testing Tools that OWASP community has created</description></item><item><title>How Variant Analysis and CodeQL helped secure the fight against COVID-19</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/write-codeql-queries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/write-codeql-queries/</guid><description>About this session In security, ‘variant analysis’ is the process of searching for variants of known vulnerabilities.
This used to be done with grep and painstaking manual code audits, but it can be automated with a powerful semantic query language like CodeQL.
I will show how we performed a variant analysis using CodeQL which started analyzing a vulnerability in Nexus Repository Manager and ended up finding many other critical vulnerabilities including a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Germany&amp;rsquo;s Corona-Warn-App (German&amp;rsquo;s Contact tracing app).</description></item><item><title>Maturity Mapping: Contextualise change and learning</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/wardley-maps/maturity-mapping-contextualise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/wardley-maps/maturity-mapping-contextualise/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Remote Threat Modeling</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/remote-threat-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/remote-threat-modeling/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Scaling Incident Response using Jira, Jupyter and GSuite</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/scaling-incident-response-using-jira-jupyter-gsuite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/scaling-incident-response-using-jira-jupyter-gsuite/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Schrems II - Finding workable solutions</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/schrems-ii/schrems-ii-finding-workable-solutions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/schrems-ii/schrems-ii-finding-workable-solutions/</guid><description>About this talk: We will continue talking about Schrems II, its impact and measures that can be taken to make personal data transfers work legally.
