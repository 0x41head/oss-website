It allows you to profile applications 24/7 in production environments and find performance issues down to a single line of code.
In this session we&amp;rsquo;re gonna go over the internals of Pyroscope storage engine and how we are able to store data efficiently and also talk about how pyroscope can be useful for various use cases.</description></item><item><title>Schrems II - Transfer risk triage and other adventures in scoping</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/schrems-ii/schrems-ii-transfer-risk-triage-and-other-adventures-in-scoping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/schrems-ii/schrems-ii-transfer-risk-triage-and-other-adventures-in-scoping/</guid><description>About this talk: A robust data protection or cybersecurity risk assessment is a specialist undertaking. Specialists are in short supply. If your assessment target handles very little data and can be down for a month, how serious can a broken control really be? You cannot pen test everything. Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. Thatâ€™s where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in. Oversimplification gifted us a thousand tick-box compliance memes and arbitrary scoping decisions, often just based on spend.</description></item><item><title>SDA SE Cluster Scanner is going Open Source</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</guid><description>About this session The Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans. As a developer, the Cluster Scanner works out of the box. As a system operator, I just add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example ArgoCD.
History, DevSecOps journey, use cases, architecture and the different security scans of the Cluster Scanner will be described. Feedback from you is very welcome in this talk.</description></item><item><title>Secure By Scenario</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Serverless static analysis with O2 Platform</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/owasp/serverless-static-analysis-with-o2-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/owasp/serverless-static-analysis-with-o2-platform/</guid><description>About this session This session will focus on how to use O2 Platform&amp;rsquo;s Static Analysis tools in a serverless (AWS Lambda) environment
O2 Platform The O2 platform represents a new paradigm for how to perform, document and distribute Web Application security tests and scripts.
O2 is designed to Automate Security Consultants Knowledge and Workflows and to Allow non-security experts to access and consume Security Knowledge
In practice the O2 Platform is a collection of Open Source modules that help Web Application Security Professionals to maximize their efforts and quickly obtain high visibility into an application&amp;rsquo;s security profile.</description></item><item><title>Spreading security across the SDLC (with semgrep and other tools)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/spreading-security-across-the-sdlc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/spreading-security-across-the-sdlc/</guid><description>About this session</description></item></channel></rss>
