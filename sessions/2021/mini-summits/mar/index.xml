Specialists are in short supply. If your assessment target handles very little data and can be down for a month, how serious can a broken control really be? You cannot pen test everything. Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. Thatâ€™s where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in.

O2 Platform The O2 platform represents a new paradigm for how to perform, document and distribute Web Application security tests and scripts.
O2 is designed to Automate Security Consultants Knowledge and Workflows and to Allow non-security experts to access and consume Security Knowledge
In practice the O2 Platform is a collection of Open Source modules that help Web Application Security Professionals to maximize their efforts and quickly obtain high visibility into an application&amp;rsquo;s security profile.</description></item><item><title>Spreading security across the SDLC (with semgrep and other tools)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/spreading-security-across-the-sdlc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/spreading-security-across-the-sdlc/</guid><description>About this session</description></item></channel></rss>
