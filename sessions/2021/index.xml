Traditionally, this happens in workshops with lots of discussion and model work on the whiteboard with boxes, lines, and clouds. It’s just a pity that in some agile projects it stops there: Instead of a living model, a slowly but surely eroding artifact is created, while the agile project evolves at a faster pace.</description></item><item><title>ASVS User Stories creation</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation-part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation-part-5/</guid><description>About this session Continuing a project started at OSS in 2018, we’ll talk about User stories (what they are and how to write them, and continue the contribution to the ASVS Agile Delivery guide https://github.com/mario-platt/ASVS-Agile-Delivery-Guide with the intent of breaking down into smaller groups and continue development</description></item><item><title>ASVS User Stories creation - Part 6</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation-part-6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation-part-6/</guid><description>About this session Continuing a project started at OSS in 2018, we’ll talk about User stories (what they are and how to write them, and continue the contribution to the ASVS Agile Delivery guide https://github.com/mario-platt/ASVS-Agile-Delivery-Guide with the intent of breaking down into smaller groups and continue development</description></item><item><title>ASVS User Stories creation - Part 7</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation/</guid><description>About this session Continuing a project started at OSS in 2018, we’ll talk about User stories (what they are and how to write them, and continue the contribution to the ASVS Agile Delivery guide https://github.com/mario-platt/ASVS-Agile-Delivery-Guide with the intent of breaking down into smaller groups and continue development</description></item><item><title>ASVS User Stories creation - Part 8</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation/</guid><description>About this session Continuing a project started at OSS in 2018, we’ll talk about User stories (what they are and how to write them, and continue the contribution to the ASVS Agile Delivery guide https://github.com/mario-platt/ASVS-Agile-Delivery-Guide with the intent of breaking down into smaller groups and continue development</description></item><item><title>Beginners Threat Modeling</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/threat-modeling/beginners-threat-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/threat-modeling/beginners-threat-modeling/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Challenges in IoT security: from infinite recommendations to a plethora of implementations</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/challenges-in-iot-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/challenges-in-iot-security/</guid><description>About this session The Internet of Things (IoT) is quickly becoming one of the messiest IT landscapes around. Why? Because the IT industry&amp;rsquo;s supercharged development capabilities far outpace regulatory bodies' ability to set boundaries and minimal security requirements. In the meantime, a few organizations have put forth recommendations, but not everyone follows them, and sometimes it gets lost in translation. As such we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at various regulations and recommendations, and then see where some of what exists on the market today is lagging behind</description></item><item><title>ClusterScanner Demonstration</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jul/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration/</guid><description>About this session Discover vulnerabilities and container image misconfiguration in production environments. The Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security tests. It is recommended to run the Cluster Scanner in production environments. As a developer, the Cluster Scanner works out of the box. As a system operator, I just have to add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example Argo CD. The benefit is to get feedback on what is in production and not what should be in production.</description></item><item><title>Content Delivery &amp; Security Association</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/governance/cdsa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/governance/cdsa/</guid><description>About this session Content owners want to protect their key media assets as they move through stages from planning, production, post and distribution.
This talk is an update on progress with mapping controls from CSA, CIS, OWASP and ISO to reduce the need for custom controls for the media &amp;amp; entertainment supply chain and to make it easy for smaller vendors to improve their security while keeping up to date with the latest best practice and responding to the latest threats</description></item><item><title>DSOMM News and Belts-Workshop</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/dsomm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/dsomm/</guid><description>About this session Some updates regarding the application will be disscussed.

Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s SDLC, OWASP SAMM, BSIMM, and more recently NIST, have threat modeling as a foundation stone in the SDLC which will help in finding vulnerabilities and preventing their exploitation by taking the perspective of an attacker. &amp;ldquo;Think like an attacker&amp;rdquo; is easier said than done. Practitioners come to Cybersecurity from different backgrounds: development, system or network administration, compliance, pentesting, and many others.</description></item><item><title>New OSS Projects</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/new-oss-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/new-oss-projects/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS DevSecOps projet</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/devsecops-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/devsecops-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS OWASP Project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/owasp-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/owasp-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS Semgrep project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/semgrep-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/semgrep-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS Threat Modeling and Moldable Development Projects</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/threat-modeling-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/threat-modeling-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Reciprocity: Tales of an Anthropologist in Cybersecurity</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/reciprocity-why-the-cybersecurity-industry-needs-more-anthropologists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/reciprocity-why-the-cybersecurity-industry-needs-more-anthropologists/</guid><description>About this session In this 1 hour session Lianne will discuss:
By 2025 it is estimated $10.5 trillion will be lost to cyber criminals.
Hacking humans is a very lucrative business. Social engineering is one of the easiest and most effective ways to access a secure system. Cyber criminals know this, and they are increasingly leaning on the research and techniques of the social science disciplines to leverage the human element into letting them into our lives, our businesses and our bank accounts.</description></item><item><title>Rules &amp; Recommendations: Are we pushing our new IoT device out correctly?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/rules-recommendations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/rules-recommendations/</guid><description>About this session A tabletop-esque interactive session pitting 2-3 groups against one another. Whether you are in the IT &amp;amp; production department, among the executives or a part of the regulatory bodies, your job is to determine how to move forward to ship a new IoT product rapidly and securely, without awaking the regulatory bodies' wrath. Bring your party forward along the allotted timeline and influence other parties decisions in order to ship your product in time.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Kubernetes - One Pod per file</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-kubernetes-one-pod-per-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-kubernetes-one-pod-per-file/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Scaling Your Security Program with Semgrep</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-security-program-with-semgrep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-security-program-with-semgrep/</guid><description>About this session This Seesion will run from 17:00-19:00 BST Between Agile, DevOps, and infrastructure as code, development is happening faster than ever. As a security team, it can be tough to keep up.
How can we help empower our engineering counterparts to ship software quickly and securely?
This workshop will be a hands-on masterclass of using Semgrep (https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep), an open source, lightweight static analysis tool, to do just that.</description></item><item><title>Secure Access to Kubernetes pods using teleport</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/secure-access-to-kubernetes-pods-using-teleport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/secure-access-to-kubernetes-pods-using-teleport/</guid><description>About this session Session to show how to use the Open Source Teleport tool to secure access to Kubernetes pods</description></item><item><title>Secure By Scenario</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Security-Scan your production images</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration.md/</guid><description>About this session The ClusterScanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans.
