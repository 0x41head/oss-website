The Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security tests. It is recommended to run the Cluster Scanner in production environments. As a developer, the Cluster Scanner works out of the box. As a system operator, I just have to add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example Argo CD. The benefit is to get feedback on what is in production and not what should be in production.</description></item><item><title>CTO Roundtable</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/cto-roundtable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/cto-roundtable/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Rules &amp; Recommendations: Are we pushing our new IoT device out correctly?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/rules-recommendations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/rules-recommendations/</guid><description>About this session A tabletop-esque interactive session pitting 2-3 groups against one another.
