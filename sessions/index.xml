By outsourcing the platform to a trusted cloud provider, you accelerate innovation and stay ahead of the competition.
Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of losing control. We lately hear a lot of anxiety when our customers say: “We need to migrate our stack to EU jurisdiction, or our customers are not buying.</description></item><item><title>IoT: pervasive vulnerability, threat landscape and end-users</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/threat-modeling/iot_pervasive_vulnerability_threat_landscape_and_endusers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/threat-modeling/iot_pervasive_vulnerability_threat_landscape_and_endusers/</guid><description>About the session: The aim is to discuss how vulnerability persists in the IoT industry, how higher budget by manufacturers doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily translate to better security and how end-users are affected by cyberattacks, ransomware and government regulation.</description></item><item><title>Making ASVS truly yours</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/owasp/making_asvs_truly_yours/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/owasp/making_asvs_truly_yours/</guid><description>About this session Without a doubt, ASVS is a great standard for getting security requirements right from the beginning.
Chances are, that if you work at a big corporation your current requirements don&amp;rsquo;t cover when half the ground that ASVS covers.
If you work at a small company or startup there might not even be a set of requirements.
In either case, it would be great to be able to take ASVS and make it truly your own: your corporate image fonts, cover, maybe change the document&amp;rsquo;s name or match it to current requirements that might already exist.</description></item><item><title>OWASP Security Bot - Hypercharge your Cloud Automation</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/owasp/owasp-security-bot-hypercharge-your-cloud-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/owasp/owasp-security-bot-hypercharge-your-cloud-automation/</guid><description>About this session Learn how to use the OWASP Security Bot to Hypercharge your Cloud Automation</description></item><item><title>OWASP Wrong Secrets: project goals, under the hood, and where do we go from here?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/owasp/owasp_wrong_secrets_project_goals_under_the_hood_and_where_do_we_go_from_here/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/owasp/owasp_wrong_secrets_project_goals_under_the_hood_and_where_do_we_go_from_here/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Predicting the rise and fall of an open source project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/governance/predicting-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-open-source-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/governance/predicting-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-open-source-project/</guid><description>About this session Open source software and its rich and vast ecosystem is one of the largest enablers of modern digitalization, but is all open source equal? In this talk, we explore the rise and fall of open source projects by looking at community health from a quantitative perspective. Join us for a deep dive into the world of data to explore early indicators that may help us predict the success, or fall, of an open source community.</description></item><item><title>Privacy As Code: Open-Source Developer Tools For Data Privacy</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/devsecops/privacy_as_a_code_open_source_developer_tools_for_data_privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/jan/devsecops/privacy_as_a_code_open_source_developer_tools_for_data_privacy/</guid><description>About this session This will be a walkthrough of our team’s recently released open-source developer toolset for privacy. I’ll show how you can make things like privacy risk assessment an automated part of the CI Pipeline, and share some thoughts about how we think privacy is treading the same path that AppSec laid in recent years.
