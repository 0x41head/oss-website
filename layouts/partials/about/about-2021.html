            <p>The Open Security Summits (OSS) 2022 are focused on the collaboration between developers and application security. These Summits have been running for 13 years. It used to be held at Centre Parcs Woburn Forest in the United Kingdom. However, at the moment it takes a different format.
                It's being held 100% virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It offers bi-monthly, high-energy experience of training and working sessions. This is not a conference with just some unidirectional presentations. Every thoroughly prepared working session is geared towards a specific Application Security challenge and will be focused on actionable outcomes.
                Thus the attendees will get a unique chance to work and collaborate intensively.</p>

            <p>Both, the trainings and the main sessions cover a wide range of important and interesting topics related to Threat modeling, Inspection and Sanitisation Guidance (ISG) standards, Wardley maps, cybersecurity, CISO and risk management, social engineering, COVID apps and many others.</P>
