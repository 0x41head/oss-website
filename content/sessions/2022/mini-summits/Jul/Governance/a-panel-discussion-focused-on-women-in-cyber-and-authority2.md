## About this session

- This discussion will aim to explore authority issues connected to women in cyber particularly during the onboarding process and regarding retention. We will aim to explore:
- who people in cyber look to as authority figures in cyber today
- examine whether there may be any pre-programmed biases in the sector in prioritising male authority figures;
- how this is reflected in sector-specific literature - the citation and reference to female voices,
- whether there is a relationship between these ideas around authority and the confidence/competence debate,
- how this dichotomy in turn impacts communication between female hires and their managers during the recruitment process,
- how women feel being managed by other women as well as by men, 
- whether/how these ideas and dynamics work differently in new start-up business models than in established business hierarchies.
