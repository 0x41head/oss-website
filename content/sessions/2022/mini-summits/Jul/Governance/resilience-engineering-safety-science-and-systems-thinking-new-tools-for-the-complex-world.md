## About this session
In this panel, we'll have a number of security professionals who have been using different methods based on Resilience Engineering, Safety Science and Systems thinking in how they approach the practice of information and cyber security. We'll hear first hand how transformative these approaches can be and the benefits and challenges they bring.
