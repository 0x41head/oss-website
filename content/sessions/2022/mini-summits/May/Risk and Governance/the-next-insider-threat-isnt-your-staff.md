## About this session
Since the early research on Insiders so much has changed, from the range of technologies blocking desktops and laptops to the wired network those devices operate on. The improvements from technology vendors have got so much better that the only bad things an insider can do is click on malware.
However, in that same time the number of devices which are not managed or overseen by end users has grown. Many of these IoT devices operate off the wired network, and the number of ways that they are able to connect wirelessly has grown too.
While we are security teams are focused on their wired networks, the threat from wireless IoT devices is being ignored.
