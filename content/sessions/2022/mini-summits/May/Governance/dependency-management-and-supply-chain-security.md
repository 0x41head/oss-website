## About this session

Modern software has dependencies – lots of dependencies, especially when including the transitive ones. Most of these dependencies are open source packages downloaded from a public software repository. Any of those dependencies may have vulnerabilities, include a supply-chain attack or use unwanted licenses. All this may change with any version. That’s why actively managing dependencies should be one of the focus areas of software development.

In this session we will have a look at different techniques and tools (Renovate, Cosign, syft, …) for choosing and managing dependencies and see how keep your applications and infrastructure secure.
