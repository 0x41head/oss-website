## About this session

Reference:https://info.jupiterone.com/resources/scar-report-2022

Cloud security is noisy - our research shows the average organization has a backlog of over 120,000 findings from cloud security posture management and vulnerability scanning tools. Yet, despite the volume of data, security operations teams struggle to answer even seemingly simple questions about open source vulnerabilities or event triggers.

Learn why cloud attack surface management is much simpler with cyber asset and relationship graphs - using open source solutions to deploy knowledge graphs in your environment (can be accomplished with Gremlin, Sparql, or TinkerPop, as well as other OSS solutions). Weâ€™ll dive into how cloud asset relationships reveal the unique toxic combinations of misconfiguration and access, giving teams the context to distinguish between false positives and true risk.

This vendor-agnostic look at cyber relationship graphs will address:
- How to create better asset relationship graph visibility by integrating your cloud assets and security stack
- How to query relationships between users, access, owners, and developer relationships to facilitate deeper inquiry of assets
- Why context is key to a turning findings into actionable intelligence about your most critical risks
- How to scale and automate asset, vulnerability, and attack surface management practices for cloud-native environments
- A myriad of OSS tools that can be used to deploy knowledge graphs in your environment!
