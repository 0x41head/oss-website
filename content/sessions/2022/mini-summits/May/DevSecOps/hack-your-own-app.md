## About this session
As a developer, there will come a time when someone will try to hack your app, probably (hopefully) your security team or a penetration tester. Having to then go back and fix the security bugs, 6 months to a year later, can be a pain. In this talk, you’ll learn common approaches of hacking your own apps and APIs (called offensive testing) from the get-go, so that you can learn how to respond (fixing vulnerabilities in your code) earlier in the software development life cycle. And fortunately for us, just like in the movies, it’s really…not that hard!

In this session, you will learn 
How to run a DAST [dynamic application security testing] tool against a web application, 
How to find vulnerabilities in a web app,
And learn how to fix those vulnerabilities 

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so you will also learn how to defend against some common attacks from the get-go.
