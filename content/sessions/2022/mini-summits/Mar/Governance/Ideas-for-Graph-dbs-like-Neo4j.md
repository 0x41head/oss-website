## About this session

This session will focus on innovative uses cases for Graph Databases, like for example Neo4j:

### security specific

- Using Graphs in Threat Models
- Mapping out Cyber Threat Intelligence, for example using [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html)
- Using Graphs for Risk Management
- Using GitHub Repos to hold Graph/Neo4J data
- Using Graphs to map network architectures, DNS entries
- Using Graphs to map Attack Trees and Real-World incidents
- Using Graphs to map AWS IAMs relationships and usage

### Scalability
- How Neo4J compares with Jira (when Jira is used as a Graph DB)
- Why Jira + Elastic are a very powerful 'Graph DB'
- Javascript APIs to visualise Neo4J data
- Using Neo4j with Hugo (and static generated sites)
- The power of screenshots of Neo4j visualisations
- The power of creating 'search paths' with Edges
- Why being able to edit the nodes is so important
- Using Neo4J DBs as Cattle (vs Pets)
- Lightweight and Serverless Graph Dbs
