## About this session

This session will focus on innovative uses cases for Graph Databases, with a special focus on [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/).

Here are the main topics for dicussion

## Topics

### Security specific

 - Using Graphs in Threat Models
 - Mapping out Cyber Threat Intelligence, for example using [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html)
 - Using Graphs for Risk Management
 - Using GitHub Repos to hold Graph/Neo4J data
 - Using Graphs to map network architectures, DNS entries
 - Using Graphs to map Attack Trees and Real-World incidents
 - Using Graphs to map AWS IAMs relationships and usage

### Graph Specific 
 - The power of creating 'search paths' with Edges
 - Why Jira + Elastic are a very powerful 'Graph DB'
 - Why being able to edit the nodes is so important
 - Lightweight and Serverless Graph Dbs
 - Graph algorithms
 - Graph ML 
 
### Neo4J specific
 - How Neo4J compares with Jira (when Jira is used as a Graph DB)
 - Javascript APIs to visualise Neo4J data
 - Using Neo4j with Hugo (and static generated sites)
 - The power of screenshots of Neo4j visualisations
 - Using Neo4J DBs as Cattle (vs Pets)
