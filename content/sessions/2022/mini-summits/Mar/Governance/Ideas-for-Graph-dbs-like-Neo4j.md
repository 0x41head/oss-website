## About this session

This session focus on innovative uses cases for Graph Databases, like for example Neo4j:

- Using Graph DBs in Threat Models
- Using Graph Dbs for Risk Management
- How Neo4J compares with Jira (when Jira is used as a Graph DB)
- Why Jira + Elastic are a very powerful 'Graph DB'
- Javascript APIs to visualise Neo4J data
- Using GitHub Repos to hold Neo4J data
- Using Neo4j with Hugo (and static generated sites)
- The power of screenshots of Neo4j visualisations
- The power of creating 'search paths' with Edges
- Why being able to edit the nodes is so important
- Using Neo4J DBs as Cattle (vs Pets)
- Lightweight and Serverless Graph Dbs
