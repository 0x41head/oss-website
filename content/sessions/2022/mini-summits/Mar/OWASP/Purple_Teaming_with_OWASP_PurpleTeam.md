## About this session

# What is OWASP PurpleTeam?

PurpleTeam is a Developer focussed security regression testing CLI and SaaS targeting Web applications and APIs.
The CLI is specifically targeted at sitting within your build pipelines but can also be run manually.
The SaaS that does the security testing of your applications and APIs can be deployed anywhere.

Kim will briefly discuss the four year journey that has brought PurpleTeam from a proof of concept (PoC) to a production ready Developer first security regression testing CLI and SaaS.

An overview of the NodeJS micro-services with many features allowing a Build User (DevSecOps practitioner) to customise their Test Runs without having to write any tests by simply configuring a Job file.
Allowing multiple options to deal with false/true positives.
Setting alert thresholds in multiple places and for multiple testers (app-tester, tls-tester, server-tester) allowing the Build User to define what constitutes a successful or failed Test Run.

Publications: PurpleTeam came from a PoC I wrote about, built, ran workshops and spoke about in my first book: https://holisticinfosecforwebdevelopers.com/
