## About this session

Cloud technologies abstract away the messy and complex underlying platform, allowing you to focus on your magic sauce: pushing great features into your application. By outsourcing the platform to a trusted cloud provider, you accelerate innovation and stay ahead of the competition.

Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of losing control. We lately hear a lot of anxiety when our customers say: “We need to migrate our stack to EU jurisdiction, or our customers are not buying.”

I will show you how you can have both – focus your effort on your magic sauce and full control over your tech stack – by moving from a proprietary control plane to Kubernetes.

At the end of my talk, you will know how to build an open-source platform powered by Kubernetes, which not only hosts your containerized application, but also runs databases, message queues and caches. All this, while fulfilling your security needs.
