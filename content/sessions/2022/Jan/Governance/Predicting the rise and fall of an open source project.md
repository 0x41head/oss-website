## About this session
Open source software and its rich and vast ecosystem is one of the largest enablers of modern digitalization, but is all open source equal? 
In this talk, we explore the rise and fall of open source projects by looking at community health from a quantitative perspective. Join us for a deep dive into the world of data to explore early indicators that may help us predict the success, or fall, of an open source community.
