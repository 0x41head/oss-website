## About this session

Without a doubt, ASVS is a great standard for getting security requirements right from the beginning. 

Chances are, that if you work at a big corporation your current requirements don't cover when half the ground that ASVS covers. 

If you work at a small company or startup there might not even be a set of requirements. 

In either case, it would be great to be able to take ASVS and make it truly your own: your corporate image fonts, cover, maybe change the document's name or match it to current requirements that might already exist.

We'll work through the process of being able to achieve this.
