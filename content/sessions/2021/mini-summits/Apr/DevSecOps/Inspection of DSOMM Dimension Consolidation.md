## About this session
In this workshop we will discuss questions like
* Introduction of more activities like Web Application Firewalls (your experience is needed here)
* Discussion of priorization of one dimension voted by the audiance
* Enhancement of maturity levels (e.g. 5 instead of 4) to provide a better priorization
* Mapping to other models like [Gartner DevSecOps model/loop](https://github.com/wurstbrot/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/14) and expected outcome/value
* Gathering of requirements for the application

Please do not hesitate to bring your own questions.
