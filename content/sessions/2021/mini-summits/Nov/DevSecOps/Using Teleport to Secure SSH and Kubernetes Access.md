## About this session

### What is Teleport

Teleport is a Certificate Authority and an Access Plane for your infrastructure. With Teleport you can:

- Set up Single Sign-On and have one place to access your SSH servers, Kubernetes, Databases, and Web Apps.
- Use your favorite programming language to define access policies to your infrastructure.
- Share and record interactive sessions across all environments.
