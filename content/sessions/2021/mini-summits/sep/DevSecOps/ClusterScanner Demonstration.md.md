## About this session
The ClusterScanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans. As a developer, the ClusterScanner works out of the box. As a system operator, I just add the ClusterScanner in my deployment configuration.
This talk will give insights into
- The use cases,
- the different scans
- the architecture and requirements,
- a live demo
The [ClusterScanner](https://github.com/SDA-SE/clusterscanner) is OpenSource.
