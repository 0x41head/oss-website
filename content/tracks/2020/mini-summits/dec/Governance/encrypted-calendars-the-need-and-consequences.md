## About this talk:

We will brainstorm about;
- Importance of metadata when it comes to calendar invites
- Is there a PGP for calendar invites?
- FISA's impact on surveillance on unsuspecting civilians
- Third-party mobile mail/calendar apps, how they interact with the native calendar
- and other relevant topics relating to calendar privacy/confidentiality
