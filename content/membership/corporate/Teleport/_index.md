## Teleport

Teleport founders fell in love with programming by giving a computer some instructions and watching the magic happen. The close relationship between a programmer, a machine, and code felt special.
We went to college and joined the workforce. We even launched our own startups and witnessed the transition of programming from one machine to many and eventually to cloud computing. This brought enormous complexities into our lives. Half of our effort now goes towards erecting and continuously maintaining complex "cloud environments" for our programs.
Each environment consists of numerous layers of computing resources, each with its own trust model, often separated by network boundaries and overburdened with excessive configuration. Not only is this complexity slowing us down, but it is also prone to human errors, resulting in poor security.
We started the company because we found this mess with environmentsâ€¦unpleasant. We liked the simplicity of giving instructions to a computer better. Can we have that in the modern era of cloud computing?
We believe the answer is yes, but we have to let go of environments and leap into environment-free computing, i.e. fully embrace the promise of the cloud and treat the entire planet as a single, multi-tenant computer. That computer needs a simple and secure access plane.
