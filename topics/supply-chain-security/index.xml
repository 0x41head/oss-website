Most of these dependencies are open source packages downloaded from a public software repository. Any of those dependencies may have vulnerabilities, include a supply-chain attack or use unwanted licenses. All this may change with any version. That’s why actively managing dependencies should be one of the focus areas of software development.</description></item></channel></rss>
