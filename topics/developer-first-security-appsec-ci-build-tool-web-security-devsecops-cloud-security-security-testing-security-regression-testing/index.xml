PurpleTeam is a Developer focussed security regression testing CLI and SaaS targeting Web applications and APIs. The CLI is specifically targeted at sitting within your build pipelines but can also be run manually. The SaaS that does the security testing of your applications and APIs can be deployed anywhere.
Kim will briefly discuss the four year journey that has brought PurpleTeam from a proof of concept (PoC) to a production ready Developer first security regression testing CLI and SaaS.</description></item></channel></rss>
