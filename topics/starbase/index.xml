This knowledge is key to identifying security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and the blast radius of compromise.
In this session, we will walk through:
Introduction of graph database concepts as they relate to security analysis Setup and configuration of the open-source Starbase project Ingestion of metadata from multiple services into a local Neo4j database Analysis of the collected data using Cypher queries to identify potential vulnerabilities</description></item></channel></rss>
